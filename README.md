Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! Below are three (3) key data science projects I've worked on:

1. **[Comparing Demand Forecasting Models](./Project-1-Comparing-Demand-Forecasting-Models)**  
   A detailed analysis of various demand forecasting models, comparing their performance using real-world data.

2. **[Using Causal Inference to Determine the Effect of Traffic Congestion on Delivery Time](./Project-2-Traffic-Congestion-Delivery-Time-Impact/README.md)**  
   An investigation into how traffic congestion impacts delivery times, using causal inference techniques.
   
3. **[PhD Research on Statistical Inference in Recommendation Systems Evaluation](./Project-3-PhD-Research-Statistical-Inference-in-Recommendation-Systems/README.md)**  
   A deep dive into statistical evaluation methods for recommendation systems, focusing on causal inference and hypothesis testing.


Feel free to explore the project folders for in-depth analysis, code, and results!
