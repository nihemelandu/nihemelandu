# Welcome to My Research Portfolio

## Research Statement

### üî≠ Past Research
My past research focused on identifying and recommending best practices for applying statistical inference in the analysis of recommender system evaluation experiments. The goal was to enhance the reliability of performance metrics by addressing key statistical challenges and improving the accuracy of evaluation results.

### üî≠ Current Research
Currently, I am exploring causal inference techniques to estimate the true causal effects of recommended items on user behavior. This research aims to refine the reliability of performance metrics in recommender systems by better understanding the causal relationships between recommendations and user interactions.

### üî≠ Future Research Vision

My future research spans the intersection of **causal inference**, **machine learning**, and **decision-making under uncertainty**, with a focus on:

#### üìå Causal Inference in Recommender Systems
Exploring causal inference methods to estimate the true effects of recommended items on user behavior. This includes:
- Understanding direct and indirect effects of recommendations
- Improving evaluation metrics beyond clicks and conversions
- Enhancing trust in algorithmic recommendations through causal metrics

#### üìå Supply Chain Decision-Making Under Uncertainty
Applying simulation, optimization, and causal inference to improve supply chain operations in dynamic, uncertain environments:
- Modeling decisions under stochastic demand and supply
- Evaluating interventions for procurement, inventory, and logistics
- Enhancing operational robustness using counterfactual reasoning

#### üìå Integrating Machine Learning with Causal Inference
Designing hybrid frameworks that combine the predictive power of machine learning with causal reasoning to support real-world decisions:
- Scalable, data-driven causal estimation
- Interpretability in high-dimensional, complex systems
- Applications across personalization, logistics, and operations

üëâ See [RESEARCH_PLAN.md](./RESEARCH_PLAN.md) for detailed methodology and project roadmap.


## Publications

### [Statistical Inference: The Missing Piece of RecSys Experiment Reliability Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06424)
*Discusses how statistical inference is often overlooked in recommender system evaluations and outlines challenges that threaten experimental reliability.*

### [Inference at Scale: Significance Testing for Large Search and Recommendation Experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02461)
*Explores how significance tests behave in large-scale experiments, emphasizing the need to consider practical effect sizes alongside p-values.*

### [Multiple Testing for IR and Recommendation System Experiments](https://md.ekstrandom.net/pubs/ecir2024-multiple-testing.pdf)
*Examines the multiple-comparison problem (MCP) in evaluations involving more than two systems, which can lead to inflated false discoveries. This study extends the investigation to recommendation system evaluations and explores procedures that control the False Discovery Rate (FDR).*

### [Candidate Set Sampling for Evaluating Top-N Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.11723)
*Analyzes how candidate set selection strategies interact with popularity bias and affect the accuracy of evaluation metrics in top-N recommendation tasks.*

## Applied Projects üõ†Ô∏è

### **Forecasting for Predictive Modeling**  
**Skills**: Feature engineering, data preprocessing, time series analysis, machine learning (XGBoost, Random Forest), Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)

Developed a forecasting model to predict future outcomes such as customer behavior, sales, or demand, using historical data. This project demonstrates the ability to handle **time-dependent or feature-driven data** and leverage various forecasting techniques to make accurate predictions.

Key steps:
- **Feature Engineering**: Processed raw data to extract meaningful features that can help improve prediction accuracy.
- **Modeling**: Applied forecasting models (e.g., time series models for sequential data or machine learning models for feature-driven forecasting).
- **Evaluation**: Used relevant performance metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAPE) to assess model effectiveness and ensure reliable predictions.

### **Causal Inference for Estimating Treatment Effects**  
**Skills**: Causal analysis, statistical modeling, hypothesis testing, Python (Pandas, Statsmodels)

Applied **causal inference** methods to identify and estimate the causal relationships between variables in a dataset. The goal was to understand how changes in one variable directly affect another, providing insights for better decision-making and intervention planning.

Key steps:
- **Data Exploration**: Identified key variables and potential causal relationships.
- **Causal Modeling**: Applied causal inference techniques (e.g., regression discontinuity, propensity score matching, difference-in-differences) to estimate treatment effects or causal impacts.
- **Evaluation**: Validated the causal conclusions using statistical tests and sensitivity analysis.

### **Discrete-Event Simulation of Bank Client Service**  
**Skills**: Simulation modeling, Python (SimPy, Matplotlib)

Created a **discrete-event simulation** for a bank‚Äôs client service system, where clients arrive at the bank, use ATM or teller services, and leave. The simulation tracks key performance indicators, such as **resource utilization** (e.g., ATM and teller usage), and provides insights into the efficiency of the service system.

Key steps:
- **Simulation Design**: Modeled client arrival, ATM, and teller service processes as discrete events.
- **Performance Metrics**: Analyzed key metrics such as **wait times**, **resource utilization**, and **service throughput**.
- **Modeling and Analysis**: Used Python (SimPy) for modeling the system and visualized the results using Matplotlib.

## About Me

I hold a PhD with a research focus on statistical and causal inference methods for evaluating recommender systems. My work focuses on improving the reliability of recommender system evaluations by addressing statistical challenges such as significance testing, multiple comparisons, and evaluation bias. I am currently expanding into decision-making under uncertainty in supply chain operations, using simulation, optimization, and causal inference techniques.
