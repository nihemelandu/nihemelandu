# Welcome to My Research Portfolio

## Research Statement

### 🔭 Past Research
My past research focused on identifying and recommending best practices for applying statistical inference in the analysis of recommender system evaluation experiments. The goal was to enhance the reliability of performance metrics by addressing key statistical challenges and improving the accuracy of evaluation results.

### 🔭 Current Research
Currently, I am exploring causal inference techniques to estimate the true causal effects of recommended items on user behavior. This research aims to refine the reliability of performance metrics in recommender systems by better understanding the causal relationships between recommendations and user interactions.

### 🔭 Future Research Vision

My future research spans the intersection of **causal inference**, **machine learning**, and **decision-making under uncertainty**, with a focus on:

#### 📌 Causal Inference in Recommender Systems
Exploring causal inference methods to estimate the true effects of recommended items on user behavior. This includes:
- Understanding direct and indirect effects of recommendations
- Improving evaluation metrics beyond clicks and conversions
- Enhancing trust in algorithmic recommendations through causal metrics

#### 📌 Supply Chain Decision-Making Under Uncertainty
Applying simulation, optimization, and causal inference to improve supply chain operations in dynamic, uncertain environments:
- Modeling decisions under stochastic demand and supply
- Evaluating interventions for procurement, inventory, and logistics
- Enhancing operational robustness using counterfactual reasoning

#### 📌 Integrating Machine Learning with Causal Inference
Designing hybrid frameworks that combine the predictive power of machine learning with causal reasoning to support real-world decisions:
- Scalable, data-driven causal estimation
- Interpretability in high-dimensional, complex systems
- Applications across personalization, logistics, and operations

## Publications

### [Statistical Inference: The Missing Piece of RecSys Experiment Reliability Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06424)
*Discusses how statistical inference is often overlooked in recommender system evaluations and outlines challenges that threaten experimental reliability.*

### [Inference at Scale: Significance Testing for Large Search and Recommendation Experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02461)
*Explores how significance tests behave in large-scale experiments, emphasizing the need to consider practical effect sizes alongside p-values.*

### [Multiple Testing for IR and Recommendation System Experiments](https://md.ekstrandom.net/pubs/ecir2024-multiple-testing.pdf)
*Examines the multiple-comparison problem (MCP) in evaluations involving more than two systems, which can lead to inflated false discoveries. This study extends the investigation to recommendation system evaluations and explores procedures that control the False Discovery Rate (FDR).*

### [Candidate Set Sampling for Evaluating Top-N Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.11723)
*Analyzes how candidate set selection strategies interact with popularity bias and affect the accuracy of evaluation metrics in top-N recommendation tasks.*
