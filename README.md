# Welcome to My Research Portfolio

## Research Statement

My past research focused on identifying and recommending best practices for applying statistical inference in the analysis of recommender system evaluation experiments. The goal was to enhance the reliability of performance metrics by addressing key statistical challenges and improving the accuracy of evaluation results.

Currently, I am exploring causal inference techniques to estimate the true causal effects of recommended items on user behavior. This research aims to refine the reliability of performance metrics in recommender systems by better understanding the causal relationships between recommendations and user interactions.

# üì¶ Research Plan: Causal Dynamics Between Customer Behavior and Supply Chain Operations

## üß≠ Overview

This research aims to investigate the **bidirectional relationship** between algorithmic customer interactions and supply chain operations. Specifically, it explores how **digital experiences and demand signals** influence procurement, inventory, and fulfillment‚Äîand how those operational realities, in turn, shape **customer experience and satisfaction**.

The end goal is to improve **decision quality** and **operational efficiency** in complex, dynamic supply chain environments using robust causal reasoning and system modeling.

---

## üéØ Research Objectives

- Determine whether changes in customer behavior **cause** operational impacts, or are merely correlated.
- Evaluate whether improvements in supply chain performance **lead to** measurable gains in customer satisfaction or loyalty.
- Model and simulate feedback loops between demand-side behaviors and supply-side constraints.
- Inform **intervention design** that aligns customer-facing decisions with operational capabilities.

---

## üß© Research Scope

### üîç Domain Focus

To make this work tractable and actionable, the research will focus on a well-defined domain:

- **Industry selection**: Retail, e-commerce, or manufacturing (TBD)
- **Customer behavior metrics**:
  - Purchasing patterns
  - Complaint or return rates
  - Channel preferences
  - Conversion & churn
- **Operational performance metrics**:
  - Inventory turnover
  - Fulfillment accuracy
  - Delivery time & reliability
  - Flexibility and cost efficiency
- **Significance threshold**:  
  Not all statistically significant effects are **operationally meaningful**‚Äîthis research will prioritize interventions with **practical impact**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

To address the causal questions at the heart of this work, a hybrid approach will be employed, drawing from structural models, quasi-experiments, causal machine learning, and simulation.

---

### üß† 1. Structural Causal Models (SCM)

SCMs will serve as the **core reasoning framework** for this research:

- **Causal DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs)** to explicitly express assumptions
- **Structural Equations** to model data-generating processes
- **do-Calculus** to derive valid interventional estimands
- **Identification analysis**: Determine whether effects of interest can be identified from available data
- **Toolkits**: [`DoWhy`](https://github.com/py-why/dowhy), [`DAGitty`](http://www.dagitty.net/), `causalgraphicalmodels`, `Ananke`

SCMs provide conceptual rigor and clarity in defining what can (and cannot) be learned from observational data.

---

### üß™ 2. Quasi-Experimental Designs

To estimate causal effects from historical or operational data without randomization:

- **Interrupted Time Series (ITS)**
- **Synthetic Control Methods**
- **Stepped-Wedge Rollout Designs**
- **Panel Event Study Designs**
- **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)**
- **Regression Discontinuity / Kink Designs**
- **Propensity Score Matching / Weighting**

These methods leverage **natural experiments, system rollouts, shocks, or thresholds**‚Äîcommon in supply chain and digital environments.

---

### ü§ñ 3. Causal Machine Learning

To handle high-dimensional data, discover treatment heterogeneity, and support complex modeling:

- **Causal Forests** (e.g., Generalized Random Forests)
- **Double Machine Learning (DML)**
- **Meta-learners**: S-learner, T-learner, X-learner
- **Uplift Modeling** for individual-level intervention targeting

**Toolkits**: `EconML`, `CausalML`, `scikit-uplift`, `DoWhy + sklearn`

These methods enable estimation at **scale**, with interpretability and flexibility.

---

### üß™ 4. Simulation Modeling

Simulation will be used to model dynamics that are hard to capture empirically:

- **System Dynamics Models**: Capture stock-flow relationships and feedback loops (e.g., inventory ‚Üí lead times ‚Üí customer abandonment)
- **Agent-Based Models (ABM)**: Represent decision-making by individual customers, suppliers, or fulfillment centers
- **Scenario Testing**: Examine the effects of hypothetical interventions (e.g., algorithmic changes or new delivery policies)

Simulation allows us to **stress-test** causally-informed strategies in synthetic but realistic environments.

---

## üìè Evaluation Strategy

### üî¨ Simulation Validation

- **Historical backtesting**: Compare simulation outcomes to observed behavior
- **Face validity**: Are dynamics reasonable to domain experts?
- **Sensitivity analysis**: Explore robustness of outcomes to model assumptions

### üìà Empirical Evaluation

- **Causal identification**: Are estimated effects statistically and practically valid?
- **Operational interpretability**: Do findings align with stakeholder understanding?
- **Counterfactual testing**: Can the models answer "what-if" questions reliably?

---

## üîÑ Future Directions

- Model **algorithmic feedback loops**, e.g., recommender systems affecting demand patterns, which then affect fulfillment capabilities.
- Extend to **omnichannel environments** where customer behavior spans physical and digital touchpoints.
- Explore real-time adaptive decision systems combining causal inference with online learning or reinforcement learning.

## Future Research Goals

### Causal Inference in Recommender Systems
I aim to deepen my exploration of **causal inference methods** to estimate the true causal effects of recommended items on user behavior. This work will focus on refining the evaluation metrics of recommender systems by understanding the direct and indirect effects of recommendations on user actions, ultimately leading to more accurate and reliable performance measurements.

### Supply Chain Decision-Making Under Uncertainty
In the future, I plan to apply **simulation modeling**, **decision optimization**, and **causal inference methods** to improve decision-making processes in **supply chain operations under uncertainty**. This research will seek to optimize supply chain decision-making, particularly in dynamic environments, and help enhance the operational efficiency of supply chains faced with uncertainty in demand, supply, and logistics.

### Integrating Machine Learning with Causal Inference
A significant goal of my future work is to integrate **machine learning** with **causal inference** methods to develop more robust, data-driven solutions for both recommender systems and supply chain applications. This will involve designing novel frameworks that combine the power of ML models with causal reasoning to provide deeper insights and better decision-making capabilities in real-world systems.
